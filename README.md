Test Repository for programming ideas

Hello techies,

Eddy04 is here, and I like to create new things everyday. From art, coding, anything that gives me the oportunity to create new, change or geek on stuff. I'm starting this github account to get my code on on web dev and design. Trying to focus more on my passion.

Let the journy begin!
